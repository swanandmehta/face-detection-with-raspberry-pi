# Face detection with raspberry-pi

### Backstory ###
I had few raspberry pi 3 b+ laying around for while so i decided to do something with it.
last time i created door bell from it this time i thought maybe i could do something else
idk why this but it is what it is.

Now What does it do 
It will run continuously till you kill the application it would get img from webcam or camara module 
process it and store it under output frame folder afterwards it will wait till you have atleast 60 imgs
and create short video of it with 5 FPS and once done it will remove all those imgs

### How to run it ###
TBD I need a break.... will update soon
